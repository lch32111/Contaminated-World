I did this project with other two colleagues.
So, this is the list where I implemented many features on this project.
And each of these files means I wrote more than 80% of each file by myself.

1. Overall System and Structure on this game (plus the plan of this game)
2. AssetManager.h/.cpp
3. BitmapText.h/.cpp (I referred to the lazyfoo's code)
4. CIMG.h/.cpp
5. Core.h/.cpp
6. EndingMenu.h/.cpp
7. FileParser.h/.cpp
8. GameItem.h/.cpp
9. Map.h/.cpp
10. MapLevel.h/.cpp
11. MapObject.h/.cpp
12. Monster_Munzi.h/.cpp
13. Monster_Orc.h/.cpp
14. Music.h/.cpp
15. PIMG.h/.cpp
16. Player.h/.cpp
17. RankingMenu.h/.cpp
18. RMedicine.h/.cpp
19. Data structure of cwm extension file (Contaminated World Map)
20. Data structure of cwmo extension file (Contaminated World Map Object)
21. Data structure of cwrt extension file (Contaminated World Ranking Table)

you can see the text information of user-created extension file(cwm,cwmo,cwrt) 
if you open the files on .txt.
